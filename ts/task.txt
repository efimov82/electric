Task: 
Create simple table game 'Electric'

Description:
The game takes place on a field of 5x5 cells, where each cell represents a "light bulb". 
The "light bulb" can have two states: "On" and "Off". The "electrician" (ie the player) by 
clicking on any cell "lightbulb" takes it to the "ON" state, while all nearby "bulbs"
 (including diagonal ones) change their current state to the opposite one. 
For additional complexity, after each move with a chance of 1 to 25, one light bulb can go out (state OFF).

Purpose of the game:
Do so that all the light bulbs burn simultaneously for the minimum number of moves.

Winnings:
If the "electrician" coped with the task, then a dialog box appears where he is shown 
his number of moves and suggests entering a name. 
By clicking on "OK", its name and result is saved in the results table.

TOP10
Make a button, by clicking on which, a dialog box appears with a list of the top 10 plaes 
who have mastered the minimum number of moves.
